# Crawlers_Automation

Crawlers_Automation is a python Project to Automate all the reviews of Hotels and Restaurants to get crawled automatically.

So, here I have scraped information about a review posted on the webiste and the following information:-

1) Reviewer's Name
2) Review Posted Date
3) Actual Review
4) Ratings
5) Reviewer's Image, etc.

Once the Reviews are scrapped, I collect it into a .csv file, apply some filtering and cleansing techniques. Then, apply some Machine Learning Techniques like Sentimental Analysis to bifurcate the review into Positive, Negative and Neutral Reviews and post it on our company's dashboard.

This Project does not need any Manual Inventions, since I have deployed a job scheduler or a CRON which in-builtly crawls everyday at midnight and posts the same reviews on our company's website.
